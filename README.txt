voice-game-processing

This project contains the processing code for working with the results of the
vocal motor learning game.  Written almost exclusively in Python, the code
does use a few 64 bit Windows binaries (written in C#) to do things like
simulate the outcome of a game trial, or use parallel threads to speed up the
computation of large solution manifolds.
